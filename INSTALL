Installing from sources
=======================

Dependencies
------------
Python >= 2.5
(latest at this moment) http://www.pygtk.org
pygtk 		2.10.6
pygobject 	2.12.3
pycairo 	1.4.0
configobj 	4.4.0 	http://www.voidspace.org.uk/python/configobj.html
pytz		2007f	http://pytz.sourceforge.net/
ipython		0.8.1

Ephemeris library - by the moment you must install this manually.
In the distribution ext folder you'll find 32 and 64 versions. 
Throw the apropiate (pysw.py,_pysw.so) in the python lib site-packages 
folder or a valid python sys path.

==============================
IMPORTANT!!!
Since version 1.2, you must reinstall pysw, as it has changed a bit. Just 
follow again previous intructions, using provided files.
==============================


(Windows users must fetch their pysw.zip from the web -
http://astro-nex.com/releases, 
and have additional dependencies:
pywin32 	https://sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32/
winshell 	http://tgolden.sc.sabren.com/python/).

Though there is a setup.py (from the source distribution), currently it is
broken due to obscure circumstances, mainly the parallel devlopment between
windows (py2exe) and linux machines. So...

You better unpack the tar in a suitable directory, and then you can execute
from there the nex.py script on the command line, or you can run the
install_cmd, which put a nex command in your home bin folder (hopefully you have
one!) 
If you want to create an icon on your desktop, there is a nice png in the 
astronex/resources folder.

You must also install the font Astro-Nex.ttf, from the astronex/resources
folder, or you will see nothing.

Enjoy!
